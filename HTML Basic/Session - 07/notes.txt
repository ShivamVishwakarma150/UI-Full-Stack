HTML File Extension
====================

.html -> always prefer 
.htm 
there is no technical difference.
both are same.
FileName contain two parts 
    - Primary Name -> Max 8 chars  
    - Secondary Name  -> max 3 chars 
    sample.html -> sample.htm -> in MS Word (When we write something and save as web page in Ms Word)

Structure of HTML Page 
----------------------

1. Document Declaration 
    This Document Declaration tels the parser which version of HTML you are using.
    <!DOCTYPE html> -> For HTML5 Version 
    if there is not <!DOCTYPE html> -> for lower version 

    <> Token - Start Tag 
    </> End Token - End Tag 
    <!> Not a Tag 
    <!DOCTYPE html> comment


2. Document Scope -> indicates where a Document start and where it ends.
    <html>
    </html>
It specifies the start and end of a document.
we can use 2 Document in same html page but browser internally combines then and pack them in a single body.

FAQ : Can a browser display multiple documents?
Ans: Yes. It will merge all documents into one <body>.

Document Attribute 
- lang = language
we have to tell browser also which language we are using. from which region you are using.
A web page must contain document Declaration, document scope.

lang is Attribute there is no property in HTML. property comes when you are dealing with dynamic pages in JS.

EG:
lang=en-in   - not good (valid)
lang="en-in" (valid) -> Most Prefer
lang='en-in' (valid) -> use in case " '' " only

<html lang="en-in">

</html>


Every Document scope at high level there is 2 section.

a) Head 
    <head></head> -> Kept most of time in Memory
b) Body 
    <body></body> -> Kept Most of time in Browser
