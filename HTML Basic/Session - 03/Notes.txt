Web Server 
==========
- Local Web Server 
    - Installed on your PC 
    - host your application and test 
        IIS 
        Tomcat
        XAMP 
        Lighttpd 

- Cloud Server 
    - Firebase
    - Mongo 
    - AWS
    - Azure

In Windows We Have By Default a Server Called IIS 
Web Server - IIS - Internet Information Services Manager

Locate Web Server on your Windows PC:
- Open window control panel
- Switch to "Large Icons"
- Administrative Tools
- Look for "Internet Information Services Manager"

Test Web Server

- Open any Browser : IE, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari

What is a Web Site?
- Website is a virtual directory that provide access to the resources on server.

        Site = Location = drive and directory
        Web  = Location on web server
    alias : Netflix http://localhost/netflix           
                        virtual path 
                    http://127.0.0.1/netflix 
    physical path: C:\netflix 

Creating Website is all about adding virtual directory.

- Web Page is used for accessing resources via UI pages because no one can easily remember address of exact resources.
